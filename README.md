Grab & Stack by Jeremy Reaban

This is a simple game (right now) where the goal is to pick up a box and place it on the corresponding pallet with the same color.
Apologies for those with color blindness, I do intend to later add labels.

Currently 10 boxes will spawn, and after that a boss is spawned. It will chase you and do damage until all the boxes are placed
on the correct pallets.

Movement is WASD or arrow keys, shift to sprint, mouse controls look, right click picks up a box, right click drops a box

This somewhat simulates my job at Walmart and it's something I wanted to make for a while.
